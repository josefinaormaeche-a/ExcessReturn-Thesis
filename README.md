# ExcessReturn-Thesis
Excess return prediction using classification and regression models. 
In the files you will find:

*R scripts Risk Free Rate and MarketReturn: Data cleaning and Logistic Regression for those two datasets

*R scripts edge/non edge cases: Logistic regression for edge and non-edge case segmentation from the market return dataset (dataset 2)

*T- Complete classiifcation models: Jupyter notebook for classification tasks -random forest, random forest with recursive feature elimination and knearest neighbors- for market return dataset

*T- Complete regression models: All regression models -Lasso, random forest, random forest with interaction terms, histogram gradient boosting and the average model- for dataset 2

All visualizations (charts, correlation matrix, return distribution) can also be found within both jupyter notebooks.
